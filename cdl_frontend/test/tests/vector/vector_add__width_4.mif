// MIF file for vector tests
// Each vector has 4 32-bit fields
// The first two are the inputs for the next clock period (driven off the rising edge of the clock)
// The last two are the expected output values at the end of this clock period (i.e. the rising edge that drives the input values)
// Reset is asserted for the first three clock edges
