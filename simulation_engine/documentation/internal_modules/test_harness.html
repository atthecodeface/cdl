The test harness is a module that can be instantiated to have an exec_file script that executes in a simulation.
It is always clocked with a single clock.
It may have any number of inputs, and any number of outputs.

It basically has a small set of commands to control its inputs and outputs, and to do time control.
It also has full access to the exec_file main commands (obviously); this support multithreading.
It also can use the waveform, coverage and simulation support exec_file commands

reset <output signal name> <integer value>

immediately set an output to a value; does not wait for the next clock edge. This should be used for reset signals, for example. Most everything else should be clocked.

drive <output signal name> <integer value>

On the next clock edge set the output signal name to the given value

wait <number of cycles>

Wait the given number of cycles

wait_until_value <input> <value>

Wait until the input signal hits the given value; this signal is tested just prior to every clock edge.

wait_until_change <input>

Wait until the input signal changes; this signal is tested just prior to every clock edge.


Also a single function is added:

integer input(<string input name>)

Get the current integer value of an input
